WHO has developed numerous resources to support health inequality monitoring, which are all accessible through the Health Inequality Monitor website: 
- health inequality data repository; 
- HEAT and HEAT Plus; 
- statistical codes; 
- the handbook on health inequality monitoring; 
- step-by-step manuals and the companion workbook; 
- the state of inequality and explorations of inequality reports; 
- and health inequality monitoring eLearning courses.  

The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT and HEAT Plus) is **an interactive application** that allows users **to explore patterns of inequality in disaggregated data**, calculate summary measures of inequality, compare inequality between settings, and create and export customized graphs, maps and tables. 
HEAT, Built-In Database Edition, comes pre-installed with datasets from the health inequality data repository, while HEAT Plus, Upload Database Edition, allows users to upload and work with their own database.
