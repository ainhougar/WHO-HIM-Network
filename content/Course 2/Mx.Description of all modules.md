| Household Surveys                                      | Reliable data source for LMIC.  <br>Population-based & probabilitically selected sample (selection of people is random).  <br>Purpose: Evaluating topics at national & sub-national level.  <br>Ominbus design: Cover multiple themes across differen models within the same survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Health indicators and inequality dimensions.  <br>Sometimes physical examinations are included (and may measure biomarkers)                                                                     | Self-reported info through interviews & questionnaires.  <br>Typically every 3 to 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | If anticipated that the survey has low sample size in certain subgroups, then oversamplingi may occur.  <br>Surveys are versatile: questions and methodologies can be adpated between survey rounds.  <br>Multicountry surveys that generate harmonized data across multiple settings facilitate benchmarking. | Certain inequality dimensions are not routinely captured (sexual orientation & gender identity)  <br>Certain subcategories are not reflected in response options.  <br>Certain regions are excluded because innaccessible due to conflict.  <br>Some surveys may not be suited for double or mutliple disaggregation. (because of small sample size of subgroups).  <br>Require many resources and are expensive.                                                                                            | Regular repetition & harmonization of question across countries.  <br>Sample sizes among minority population groups should be increased.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Adminstrative Data Sources                             | Three types of records:  <br>Individual records: info on health services provided to individuals.  <br>Service records: data on management of local health services (can generate national statistics on health service use, make comparison across facilities, regions and time).  <br>Resource records: info on quality, availability and logistics of health service inputs (distribution of health facilities, budgets, expenditures). GIS (geographic information system) an be used to exploit this data  <br>Only contain information about individual who interact with a given institution.  (so data is NOT representative of the whole population). | Diverse in scope and type of information. May contain health indicators, dimensions of inequality or both.  <br>Data about inequality dimensions (other than geographical location) is limited. | During administrative and operational activities.  <br>Information available for individual or for small areas (districts or municipalities) .  <br>Collected at local levels of the health care system. They present opportunities for monitoring inequalities between lower administrative levels.   <br>They are usually collected close to real-time (sometimes data is collected as part of routine activities) | Numerous and widely available across sectors.  <br>Affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Fragmented or of poor quality, especially in settings where health (and other) information systems are weak.  <br>Lack of electronic medical records may be a problem (limit data accessibility).  <br>Linking across sources may be required since often times data collected can be topic specific.  <br>  <br>The biggest limitation is not providing data on the denominator, i.e:  contain data about the number of ppl who received a service but not the number of people eligible for that service). | Denominator values may be estimated via census data or GIS data.  <br>Collect data on individuals (age, sex, socioeconomic indicators) or small-area identifiers for future linkages.  <br>Introduce documented processes for checking data completeness.  <br>Electronic records for better linkage and accessibility. |
| Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems (CRVS) | Collect information from all members of the population to generate key population statistics.  <br>Most reliable data source to track fertility, mortality rates., life expectancies and cuases of death at a population level (includes age, sex and location).  <br>Important for decision-making, developping policies and planning services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Issue birth and death certificates, record marriage/divorces and, disseminate statistics on causes of death.                                                                                    | At time of event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Have varied implications, including SDG monitoring.  <br>Fertility statistics guide the need for family planning, school enrolment and immunization coverage.  <br>Mortality statistics are used to understand healthcare needs, monitor interventions and, prioritize health needs.                           | In most low- and middle-income countries becauseCRVS sources are incomplete.

Some words about topics in module 5 to 6. 

**M5. Data sourcing**: 

The main goal of data source mapping is **to determine where data for health inequality monitoring can be sourced**. Data source mapping creates **an inventory of available data sources** that contain information about health indicators and dimensions of inequality – and then facilitates cross-referencing between sources. 

Data source mapping can be broken down into four sequential tables, each building on the previous. 

- Table 1: Creating a list of available data sources, specifying the source type (census, administrative source, household survey, CRVS, etc.), the name of the source, and the year (or years) of data collection.
- Table 2: An expanded version of the first, focusing on dimensions of inequality.
- Table 3: table compiles the health indicator data contained within each data source
- Table 4: Integrates the information from the second and third tables, indicating the data sources that contain both health indicator and dimension of inequality data. 
Online templates for these four tables are available.
As a follow up from data source mapping, the strengths and limitations of different data sources should be weighed,

**M6. Data Linking**: 
Data linking involves merging information about health indicators and dimensions of inequality from different data sources using a common identifier.  

Building on the data source mapping exercise outlined in Module 5, an additional fifth table can be created to assess the possibility of data linking. 
It is important to adhere to data protection protocols to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. 

If HIM cannot proceed as planned (lack of data), the focus of monitoring may need to be adjusted.
