Goals of module: 
-  Define terms 
-  Differentiate btw health **inequality** and health **inequity**; 
- describe key concepts that intersect with health inequality **monitoring activities**; 
- describe how **equity** is relevant to the SDG.

We need two elements for health inequality monitoring: (1) health indicators & (2)dimensions of inequality
### 1) Health Indicators

Health can be measured at **different levels of the health sector.** The WHO Monitoring, evaluation and review framework categorizes health indicators **into four components**:

### 2) Dimensions of Inequality

Dimensions of inequality: **criteria used to define subgroups** within a population. Subgroups are used for comparison in health inequality analysis. 
Data specific to population subgroups is known as disaggregated data. 

### Overall Definitions
**Health inequality**: **measurable difference in health across population subgroups** defined according to **dimensions of inequality**

**Health inequity**: preventable and unfair differences in health, well-being and access to quality health services across individuals, population subgroups, and countries. It arises from the **unequal and unfair distribution of power, wealth and other social resources. 

**Health equity**: the ‘absence of unfair, avoidable and remediable differences in health among population groups. 

**Monitoring** is the process of repeatedly making observations of a situation to watch for changes over time


### Related concept to HIM

**C1. Human rights & HIM:**
Human rights: **moral aspirations** based on the inherent dignity and equality of the human person expressed in the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**. 
**A human rights-based approach** specifically aims to realize human rights, including the right to health. HIM should consider how human rights are protected, promoted, enforced or violated. 

**C2. Gender:**
Gender refers to the socially constructed norms, roles, behaviours, and relations among and between women, men, girls, boys, and gender diverse people. Gender norms, roles, and relations influence individual identity, interpersonal relationships, and institutional structures and institutions. 

**C3. Social determinants of health (SDH):**

SDH are **the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age**, and **the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life** that impact health.  

Many social determinants of health operate **across multiple sectors of society**. **Multisectoral actions** for health are those **actions undertaken in non-health sectors to promote healthy populations**. 

**C3. Primary health care(PHC) & Multisectorial action for health**
 PHC refers to a holistic, person-centered, whole-of-society approach, grounded in the idea that all people, everywhere, deserve the right care, right in their community. 
 
- refers to a holistic, person-centered, whole-of-society approach, grounded in the idea that all people, everywhere, deserve the right care, **right in their community**.
- focuses on **people’s needs and preferences** as individuals and communities
- addresses health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.
- seeks impact as close as feasible to people’s **everyday environments**. 

Components of PHC: 

• addressing the **broader determinants of health through multisectoral policy and action**
• **empowering** individuals, families and communities to take charge of their own health. 
• **meeting** the majority of people’s **health needs** throughout their lives;

One of the goals of HIM is to contribute to strengthening PHC 
Equity is a cross-cutting theme that is relevant to all of the 17 **SDGs**.  SDGs30 relies on the principle of Leaving No One Behind. 

**C4. Progressive realization of universal health coverage:**
Make decisions to expand coverage of health services, extending those services to non-covered population and, as part of financial protection, reducing costs.
