**Goal of module**
Discuss the **importance and purpose of health inequality monitoring**, and describe who is involved, when it should be done, and **how it is aligned within health information systems** and other health sector activities.
**Generally** the goal of HIM is to information implementation of changes to advance health equity and improve health of disadvantaged populations. 

When undertaking health inequality monitoring, it is important to think deeply during the beginning stages about the overarching purpose of your specific monitoring activity. This, in turn, will help guide **subsequent planning about the specifics** of how monitoring will be conducted. 

These are some of the questions that one should ask before performing HIM: 

- Why is health inequality monitoring being done at this time?  
- What is the intended impact of monitoring?
- Which policy cycles or windows of opportunity are important to keep in mind?  
- How often should health inequality monitoring be done?  
- Which groups of people will use the knowledge generated from the monitoring exercise?  
- How can the interests and needs of affected populations be understood and represented?
- What are the data requirements for monitoring?
